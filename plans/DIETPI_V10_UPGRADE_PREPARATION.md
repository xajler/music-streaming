# DietPi v9 → v10 Upgrade Preparation Guide

**Created:** February 16, 2026  
**Current Version:** DietPi v9.20.1  
**Target Version:** DietPi v10.0.1+  
**Status:** ⏸️ **WAIT** - v10.0.1 is first release, wait for v10.1+ for stability

---

## Breaking Changes in DietPi v10

### System Requirements
- **Minimum Debian:** Debian 12 Bookworm (we're on Debian 13 Trixie ✅)
- **Minimum DietPi:** v8.0+ for direct upgrade (we're on v9.20.1 ✅)
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5 supported ✅

### Removed Software (Not Affecting Us)
- Pydio 8 (we don't use)
- Classic ownCloud (we don't use)
- RPi Cam Web Interface (we don't use)

### What Could Break Our Setup

1. **HDMI Bridge (HIGH RISK)**
   - Kernel updates → ALSA changes → Loopback device behavior
   - Systemd changes → Service startup order
   - **Impact:** Audio playback could stop working

2. **Roon Bridge (MEDIUM RISK)**
   - May need reinstall after kernel/system updates
   - ALSA device paths might change

3. **Network Configuration (LOW RISK)**
   - Static IP config should survive, but verify

4. **RAID/Samba (LOW RISK)**
   - Should be fine, but verify after upgrade

---

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

### 1. Full System Backup
```bash
# Backup critical configs to NAS
sudo tar -czf /mnt/nas/dietpi-v9-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  /etc/systemd/system/hdmi-bridge.service \
  /usr/local/bin/hdmi-bridge.sh \
  /etc/asound.conf \
  /etc/network/interfaces \
  /boot/dietpi.txt \
  /opt/RoonBridge \
  /etc/samba/smb.conf \
  /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf \
  /etc/fstab

# Verify backup
ls -lh /mnt/nas/dietpi-v9-backup-*.tar.gz
```

### 2. Document Current State
```bash
# Current versions
cat /boot/dietpi/.version
cat /opt/RoonBridge/VERSION
uname -r
cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION

# Service status
systemctl status hdmi-bridge roonbridge smbd mdmonitor

# Audio devices
aplay -l
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```

### 3. Test Current Functionality
- [ ] Roon playback works
- [ ] HDMI audio works
- [ ] Samba share accessible
- [ ] RAID status healthy
- [ ] Network connectivity stable

---

## Upgrade Procedure (When Ready)

### Step 1: Pre-Upgrade
```bash
# 1. Stop services (optional, but safer)
systemctl stop hdmi-bridge
systemctl stop roonbridge

# 2. Create backup (see above)

# 3. Check free space (need ~100MB minimum)
df -h /
```

### Step 2: Run Upgrade
```bash
# Run DietPi update
sudo dietpi-update

# Follow prompts:
# - Accept upgrade to v10
# - Review changes
# - Let it complete (may take 10-30 minutes)
```

### Step 3: Post-Upgrade Verification

#### A. System Check
```bash
# Verify DietPi version
cat /boot/dietpi/.version
# Should show: G_DIETPI_VERSION_CORE=10

# Check kernel version
uname -r
# Note: Kernel may have updated

# Check Debian version
cat /etc/os-release | grep VERSION
# Should still be Debian 13 (Trixie)
```

#### B. Critical Services Check
```bash
# 1. Check loopback module loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
# If missing: modprobe snd-aloop

# 2. Check audio devices
aplay -l
# Should show: Loopback and vc4hdmi1

# 3. Check HDMI connection
cat /sys/class/drm/card1-HDMI-A-2/status
# Should show: connected

# 4. Check services
systemctl status hdmi-bridge roonbridge smbd
# All should be: active (running)
```

#### C. Test HDMI Bridge
```bash
# Test HDMI audio directly
speaker-test -D hdmi:CARD=vc4hdmi1,DEV=0 -c 2 -l 1

# Check bridge logs
journalctl -u hdmi-bridge -n 50

# Check Roon Bridge logs
tail -50 /var/roon/RAATServer/Logs/RAATServer_log.txt | grep -E "Error|Warn|Loopback"
```

#### D. Test Roon Connection
1. Open Roon on Mac
2. Check Settings → Audio
3. Verify "RPI5 Bridge Loop" or "Loopback PCM" appears
4. Try playing a track
5. Check for errors in Roon

---

## If HDMI Bridge Breaks After Upgrade

### Symptoms
- Roon shows "FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED" errors
- Bridge service crash-looping
- No audio output

### Fix Steps
```bash
# 1. Stop bridge
systemctl stop hdmi-bridge

# 2. Restart Roon Bridge first
systemctl restart roonbridge
sleep 5

# 3. Check if bridge script needs update
cat /usr/local/bin/hdmi-bridge.sh
# Verify it matches current working version

# 4. Check ALSA config
cat /etc/asound.conf
# Verify loopback config is correct

# 5. Reload loopback module
modprobe -r snd-aloop
modprobe snd-aloop

# 6. Restart bridge
systemctl start hdmi-bridge

# 7. Check logs
journalctl -u hdmi-bridge -f
```

### If Still Broken
1. Restore bridge script from backup
2. Check kernel/ALSA changes in release notes
3. May need to adjust bridge script for new kernel
4. Check DietPi forums for similar issues

---

## If Roon Bridge Breaks After Upgrade

### Symptoms
- Roon Bridge not detected in Roon
- Service fails to start
- Connection errors

### Fix Steps
```bash
# 1. Check Roon Bridge version
cat /opt/RoonBridge/VERSION

# 2. Check service status
systemctl status roonbridge

# 3. Check logs
journalctl -u roonbridge -n 50

# 4. May need to reinstall Roon Bridge
cd /opt
# Download latest version
curl -O https://download.roonlabs.net/builds/roonbridge-installer-linuxarmv8.sh
chmod +x roonbridge-installer-linuxarmv8.sh
yes | ./roonbridge-installer-linuxarmv8.sh

# 5. Restart service
systemctl restart roonbridge
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Upgrade Fails)

### Option 1: Restore from Backup
```bash
# Extract backup
cd /
sudo tar -xzf /mnt/nas/dietpi-v9-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz

# Restore services
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart hdmi-bridge roonbridge
```

### Option 2: Reinstall DietPi v9
- Flash fresh DietPi v9 image to SD card
- Restore configs from backup
- Reinstall Roon Bridge

## Recommended Timeline

**Now (v10.0.1):** ⏸️ **WAIT**
- First release, likely has bugs
- Wait for v10.1 or v10.2 for stability

**Monitoring for v10.1 Release:**
- Check DietPi release notes: https://dietpi.com/docs/releases/
- Monitor DietPi forums: https://dietpi.com/forum/
- Search for: "v10.1" + "audio" or "ALSA" or "HDMI" issues
- Check GitHub issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues

**After v10.1+ Released:**
- Wait 2-4 weeks after v10.1 release for bug reports
- Check DietPi forums for HDMI/audio issues
- Verify no breaking ALSA/kernel changes reported
- Review release notes for audio subsystem changes

**When Ready to Upgrade:**
- Follow this guide step-by-step
- Have backup ready (see Pre-Upgrade Checklist)
- Test during low-usage period
- Be prepared to rollback
- Allow 1-2 hours for upgrade + testing
